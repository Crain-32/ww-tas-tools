Timed for Wind Waker Rando. Done RTA, with minor mistakes.

Entrance to Hub Room
3:42.95 (Poor Execution, 3:30 is likely closer to the average time)

Enter Hub, Get Behind Statue Chest, go to PBRK
30.06 (sub 30 with practice I'd assume)

Enter Hub, Get Statue Chest, Open the Grate, Turn on the Fan, Get to Seven Armos
1:34.90


Pre-Big Key Room To Big Key Room
1:00

From Chest to Void out in BKR
32.49 (Bad ESS angle, sub 30 is expected)

Big Key Room
58.80, Slow Fight, sub 50 is likely closer to expected ; Getting back to the door takes 7 seconds (Remove this from time if you save-warp)

BKR to Many Cyclone to Hub, end after grate cutscene
1:24.54 (Opening Warp Pot takes another 2 seconds with Hammer Jumpslash)

Many Clone Room to Chest Storage point in Pre-BKR
1:15.57 (More optimal movement could lead to sub 1:10)

Open Grate Pedastal, Middle of Hub Room, To Spike Room
18.07

Open Grate Pedastal, Get Makar from PBRK, Turn on Fan, Get middle of Hub, to Armos Door
1:22.38

Open Grate Pedastal, Get Makar from PBRK, Get middle of Hub room, Turn on Fan, to Spike/Mini-Boss Door
1:08.44

Spike Room to Miniboss
8.2 (Closer to 7.5 optimally)

Spike Room / Miniboss to Seven Armos Room
25.10 (Bad Fan RNG, potential sub 20 if perfect)

Seven Armos Room
Slow Method, 56.43 ; Fast Method 41.04

Seven Armos Door, Top of Hub Chest, to Many Cyclone's Door
18.38

Seven Armos Door, Top of Hub, Middle of Hub, Spike Room Door
26.52

31.20

Spike Room
Jumpslash Method 1:08.45 ; Climbing Method 1:04.72

Mini-Boss
1:43.09

Mini-Boss to Many Enemy Room
16.6 (Perfect fan RNG, I'd assume 18 is closer to the average)

Many Enemy Room
1:43.80 (Completely optimized and practiced should lead to sub 1:35)

Many Enemy Room to Molgera
1:19.04, Optimized should be sub 1:10

Molgera Fight
2:38.24 (No storage, no cool snipe for a fast 4 cycle, timing ended once you regain control of Link after warp)

Entrance -> Behind Statue -> Chest in Left alcove -> BKC -> Many cyclone -> Open grate -> Get makar + Middle of hub -> 7 Armos -> top of Hub -> Spike Room -> Miniboss -> Many Enemy -> Finish
1124.26 seconds or 18:44.26

Entrance -> Behind Statue -> Open Grate/Warp Pot -> Turn on Fan -> Fly to 7 Armos -> Top of Hub Chest -> Many Cyclones -> Chest storage with left alcove into BKR -> Void and savewarp after BK
-> Warp to hub -> middle of hub -> spike room -> miniboss room -> many enemies room -> Molgera
1100.43 or 18:20.43
